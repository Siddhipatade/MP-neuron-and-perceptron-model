# MP-neuron-and-perceptron-model
## McCulloch – Pitts neuron
- First computational model of a neuron was proposed by "Warren MuCulloch (neuroscientist)" and "Walter Pitts (logician)" in 1943.

- Divided into 2 parts. The first part, g takes an input, performs an aggregation and based on the aggregated value the second part, f makes a decision.

- Inputs can be 'Excitatory' or 'Inhibitory'.

- Inhibitory inputs are those that have maximum effect on the decision making irrespective of other inputs 

- Excitatory inputs are NOT the ones that will make the neuron fire on their own but they might fire it when combined together.

- "Mr. Frank Rosenblatt" invented the perceptron in 1957. 
- Perceptron learning rule based on the original MCP neuron. 
- Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time.
- Four main parameters: input values, weights and Bias, net sum, and an activation function (step function). 

      Final equation: ∑w i x i +b
