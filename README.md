## McCulloch – Pitts neuron
-First computational model of a neuron was proposed by Warren MuCulloch (neuroscientist) and Walter Pitts (logician) in 1943.

-Divided into 2 parts. The first part, g takes an input, performs an aggregation and based on the aggregated value the second part, f makes a decision.

-Inputs can be Excitatory or Inhibitory

-Inhibitory inputs are those that have maximum effect on the decision making irrespective of other inputs 

-Excitatory inputs are NOT the ones that will make the neuron fire on their own but they might fire it when combined together.
